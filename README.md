A college student forum where students can signup and login and then can start discussions and can also respond to community. It includes much more.
Unfortunately misses some very basic features. Like email validation and password recovery. But I gurantee I will come back to it later. And try to make it a little better. <br>
It was actually made by taking into consideration my own college. So it may not look great if you see it from the requirement perspective of your own college/university.<br><br>
<h3>Why not to explore!</h3><br>
